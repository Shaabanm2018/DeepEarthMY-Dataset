# DeepEarthMY Dataset

**DeepEarthMY** is a remote sensing dataset for tropical land-cover segmentation in Malaysia. The dataset contains 4007 PNG images, each around 828 KB in size, representing different land-cover types including roads, buildings, water, forests, agriculture, barren land, and background.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is divided into two categories:
- **Rural**
- **Urban**

Each category contains annotated images for semantic segmentation, which can be used for training and testing machine learning models to classify various land-cover types.

### File Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

## Land-Cover Classes

The dataset provides the following land-cover classes for segmentation:
1. Roads
2. Buildings
3. Water
4. Forests
5. Agriculture
6. Barren Land
7. Background

### Usage

You can use this dataset for various computer vision tasks, particularly for **semantic segmentation**. The dataset can be loaded into deep learning frameworks like **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** for training models such as UNet, DeepLabV3, or UNetFormer.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a basic example to load the images using Python:

```python
import os
from PIL import Image

dataset_path = "path/to/DeepEarthMY_Dataset"

# Load an image from the dataset
image_path = os.path.join(dataset_path, "Rural", "image_001.png")
image = Image.open(image_path)
image.show()
